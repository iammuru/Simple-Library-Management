Create a web application using Object Oriented PHP to insert manage library application in which user 
can insert a book information containing accession number (primary key), title, author, publication, 
no. of pages, price and availability status (issued or available). The user must be able to issue and 
return books depending on their accession number. If the book has already been issued, an appropriate 
message should be displayed; similarly, when returning a book, an appropriate message should be 
presented if the book has already been returned. If issue and return are successful, 
the success message must be displayed.
